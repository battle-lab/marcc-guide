# Battle Lab Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the lab! To get started, you should:

- get added to the lab Slack workspace.
- get added to the lab calendar and determine which meetings to attend.
- get accounts to access our cloud computing and cluster computing resources.

### Important names

As of Fall 2023, four important names are:

- Rebecca Keener and Josh Weinstock, research scientists. They are a great resource for any kind of problem-solving or planning.
- Carmen Kiss is the admin for the Battle Lab and is the go-to person for scheduling.
- Sarah Bailey is the admin for the CCB, handling CCB-wide matters such as Slack access and facilities issues. 

### Slack 

The lab uses Slack for most quick communication, so don't hesitate to direct message anyone in the lab with a question. For starters, ask someone to add you to the private lab channels:  

- `#battle_lab_misc` - the lab's general channel   
- `#battle_lab_trainee` - often used for MARCC questions  
- `#battle_journal_club` - the lab has a journal club that usually runs the weeks we don't have joint group meeting  
- `#battle_lab_random` - the lab's social channel

If you're new to Slack, you should download the app on your phone and desktop.  Once you're added to the JHU Genomics Collective Slack group, here's a few public channels to join:  

- `#general` and `#random` (automatically added)  
- `#joint_group_meeting`  
- `#jhu_papers`  
- `#papers`  
- `#ccb`  
- `#ccb_students`

### Cloud Computing

Look for separate documentation in this repo. 

### Getting a MARCC account

**This is currently out of date: MARCC is out of service and we now use a cluster called Rockfish.**

To get an account with MARCC, fill out an [account request form](https://www.marcc.jhu.edu/request-access/request-an-account/), and wait for PI approval
Also check out the *[MARCC website](https://www.marcc.jhu.edu/getting-started/basic/)* and the MARCC folder

We also recommend reviewing the [marcc_guide](marcc_guide) for tips on using MARCC, access to `battle-bigmem` etc.

### Get familiar with the research

The [lab website](https://battlelab.jhu.edu/) has a *Publications* section that you can check out for a full list of the lab's previous work.  For a longer list of recommended papers in each of the lab's areas of interest, check out [this compiled list of relevant papers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mLs9rMtLIp2Xu4z7ChIIcp838jDdPdoYkHoynu_2NBY/edit). 

### Recommended courses and useful resources for Battle lab members
